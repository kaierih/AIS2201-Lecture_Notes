    "# AIS2201 - Digital Signal Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of jupyter notebooks introduces signal processing topics taught in the course [AIS2201 - Digital Signal Processing (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/AIS2201#tab=omEmnet). The material makes extensive use of computational examples and illustrations written in Python to make the material both more approachable as well as provide examples of applied theory. Each subchapter is intended to *approximately* fit into one $45$ minute lecture, and lectures will follow the lecture plan as published on the couse schedule. The lecture notes also serve as RISE slideshows, and are written authored with this use in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lecture notes will be continuously updated as the semester progresses, and any lecture notes belonging to future lectures will likely be incomplete or subject to change.\n",
